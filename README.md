# 🎬 Unity Video Player 

A hands-on guide for using Unity’s **Video Player** component will help you import videos, configure the Video Player, and render clips as full-screen cutscenes or in-world displays.

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Importing a Video
1. Drag your video file into the Unity **Assets** folder.  
2. Select the video asset and review import settings in the **Inspector**:  
   - ✅ **Transcode**: Ensures platform compatibility (recommended).  
   - ✅ **Loop**: Enable if the video should repeat.  

📸 *Example: Video asset import settings*  
![Video Import Settings](images/video-import-settings.png)

---

## 🎮 Step 2: Add a Video Player Component
1. Create an empty GameObject (`GameObject > Create Empty`).  
2. Rename it `VideoPlayer`.  
3. In the **Inspector**, click **Add Component > Video Player**.  
4. Drag your video clip into the **Video Clip** slot.  

📸 *Example: Video Player component attached to GameObject*

---

## 📺 Step 3: Choose a Render Mode

### 1. **Camera Far/Near Plane**
- Plays video **full-screen** in front of or behind a camera.  
- Perfect for cutscenes or splash screens.  
- Set `Render Mode = Camera Near Plane` or `Far Plane`.  

📸 *Full-screen video render via camera*  
![Camera Render Example](images/video-camera-mode.png)

---

### 2. **Material Override (In-World Screen)**
- Apply video as a **texture** on a 3D object (like a TV screen or billboard).  
- Steps:
  1. Create a **3D Object > Quad**.  
  2. Create a **Material** and assign it to the Quad.  
  3. In Video Player → `Render Mode = Material Override`.  
  4. Assign your Quad’s Mesh Renderer and set the property (e.g. `_MainTex`).  

📸 *In-world TV screen example*  
![Material Override Example](images/video-material-override.png)

---

### 3. **Render Texture**
- Flexible method: sends video to a **RenderTexture** asset.  
- Useful for post-processing, UI backgrounds, or custom shaders.  

Steps:  
1. Create **Assets > Create > Render Texture**.  
2. Assign it in Video Player → `Target Texture`.  
3. Use the RenderTexture in any **UI Image** or **Material**.  

📸 *Render Texture setup in Inspector*  
![Render Texture Example](images/video-render-texture.png)

---

## 🔧 Step 4: Fixing Aspect Ratio
- If the video looks **stretched**:
  - Adjust Quad’s scale when using Material Override.  
  - Match RenderTexture width/height to the video’s resolution.  

📸 *Correct aspect ratio vs stretched*  
![Aspect Ratio Fix](images/video-aspect-ratio.png)

---

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices
- ✅ Always enable **Transcode** for cross-platform support.  
- ✅ Use **Render Texture** for advanced effects (shaders, UI backgrounds).  
- ✅ Keep videos **compressed** for performance (especially mobile).  
- ✅ Use **Material Override** for immersive, in-world playback.  
- ✅ Use **Camera Render** for simple, full-screen cutscenes.  

---

## 🎯 Example Use Cases
- 🎬 **Cutscenes** → Render mode: Camera Near Plane.  
- 📺 **TV/Monitor in scene** → Render mode: Material Override.  
- 🌌 **Background animation** → Render mode: Render Texture + UI Image.

# 🎵 Unity Audio Basics

This tutorial explains how to add and control **audio in Unity**.  
It covers importing audio clips, using Audio Sources & Listeners, creating spatial sound, mixing, and scripting audio playback.

---

## 📌 What You’ll Learn
- Import audio into Unity.  
- Play sounds with **Audio Source** and **Audio Listener**.  
- Set up **2D vs 3D spatial audio**.  
- Control audio using the **Audio Mixer**.  
- Trigger sounds with **C# scripts**.  

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Importing Audio

1. Drag your audio file (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`) into the **Assets** folder.  
2. Select the clip → configure in **Inspector**:
   - ✅ **Loop** → for music or ambient sounds.  
   - ✅ **Load In Background** → avoids freezing during playback.  
   - ✅ **Preload Audio Data** → loads sound on startup.  

---

## 🔊 Step 2: Audio Source

The **Audio Source** plays the sound.  

1. Create a new GameObject → `GameObject > Audio > Audio Source`.  
2. In the **Inspector**, assign your audio clip.  
3. Key options:
   - **Loop** → repeats continuously.  
   - **Play On Awake** → starts automatically.  
   - **Spatial Blend** → choose between **2D (flat)** and **3D (positional)**.  
   
---

## 👂 Step 3: Audio Listener

- The **Audio Listener** represents the “ears” of the player.  
- Unity automatically attaches one to the **Main Camera**.  
- Only one active listener should exist in your scene.  


---

## 🎧 Step 4: 2D vs 3D Spatial Audio

- **2D Audio** → volume and pan are constant (use for UI sounds or music).  
- **3D Audio** → affected by distance and position (use for footsteps, gunfire, ambience).  

⚙️ To set:
- In **Audio Source** → adjust **Spatial Blend**:
  - `0` = 2D  
  - `1` = 3D  


---

## 🎚️ Step 5: Audio Mixer

The **Audio Mixer** allows you to balance music, SFX, and ambience.  

1. Create a Mixer → `Assets > Create > Audio Mixer`.  
2. Add groups (e.g., **Music**, **SFX**, **Ambience**).  
3. Assign an **Audio Source** to a group.  
4. Add effects (Reverb, Low-Pass Filter, Volume control).  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 6: Play Audio with Scripts

Example: play/pause audio when pressing **Spacebar**.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class AudioExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource audioSource;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            if (!audioSource.isPlaying)
                audioSource.Play();
            else
                audioSource.Pause();
        }
    }
}
```

# 🎇 Unity Particle System 

The **Unity Particle System** is a powerful feature that allows you to create visual effects such as fire, smoke, explosions, rain, sparks, and more.  
This guide provides a **beginner-friendly introduction** to using particle systems in your Unity projects.

---

## 📌 What is a Particle System?

A **particle system** is a collection of small images (called *particles*) that are animated and combined to create dynamic effects.  
Each particle can represent things like smoke puffs, fire sparks, or falling snowflakes.

Particles are controlled by a **Particle System Component**, which defines:
- How particles are emitted (rate, shape, bursts).
- How they look (material, color, size).
- How they behave over time (gravity, velocity, lifetime).

---

## ⚙️ Adding a Particle System

1. **In the Unity Editor**:
   - Right-click in the **Hierarchy** → `Effects` → `Particle System`.
   - A default particle system appears in your Scene.

2. **Adjust the Inspector**:
   - Select the Particle System in the Hierarchy.
   - The **Inspector** shows modules like *Emission, Shape, Size over Lifetime, Renderer,* etc.

---

## 🔑 Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Main** | Controls overall settings like duration, looping, start lifetime, speed, size, and color. |
| **Emission** | Defines how many particles spawn per second or in bursts. |
| **Shape** | Determines the emission shape (cone, sphere, box, mesh, etc.). |
| **Velocity over Lifetime** | Adds directional movement to particles. |
| **Size over Lifetime** | Scales particles as they age. |
| **Color over Lifetime** | Gradually changes colors during particle lifespan. |
| **Renderer** | Defines how particles are drawn (material, shader, sorting). |

---

## 🎨 Example Effects

- **Fire** 🔥: Use a **cone shape**, orange/yellow gradient colors, and fast-moving particles.
- **Smoke** 💨: Use a **sphere shape**, gray color gradient with size growing over time.
- **Rain** 🌧️: Use a **box shape**, high emission rate, and downward velocity.
- **Sparkles** ✨: Small particles with random colors and short lifetimes.

---

## 🛠️ Customizing Materials

- By default, particles use Unity’s **Default Particle Material**.
- You can create a **new material** with a shader (e.g., `Particles/Standard Unlit`) and assign a custom texture (like smoke, spark, or snowflake sprite).

---

## 📜 Sample Script Control

You can also control particle systems using **C# scripting**:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class ParticleTrigger : MonoBehaviour
{
    public ParticleSystem ps;

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            ps.Play();   // Start particle emission
        }
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.S))
        {
            ps.Stop();   // Stop emission
        }
    }
}
```

# Unity Particle Systems 🌟

This project teaches you how to create visual effects like fire, smoke, snow, and rain using Unity’s Particle System. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 🧱 Key Concepts & Components

| Component / Module | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Particle System GameObject** | The container in the scene that emits particles. Created via **GameObject → Effects → Particle System** or added as a component. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} |
| **Main Module** | Core settings: lifetime, start speed, start size, start color, looping, etc. These define how particles behave overall. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| **Emission Module** | Controls how many particles are emitted, rate over time, burst emission. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} |
| **Shape Module** | Defines the shape from which particles are emitted (sphere, cone, box, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} |
| **Other Modules** | Many additional modules like Velocity over Lifetime, Color over Lifetime, Size over Lifetime, Noise, etc. These let you fine-tune effects. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} |
| **Simulation Space** | Determines whether particles move in local space (following the emitter) or world space (independent once emitted). :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10} |

---

## ⚙️ Hands-On Steps

Here’s a simplified workflow to follow:

1. **Create a Particle System**  
   `GameObject > Effects > Particle System` (or add the component to an existing GameObject).  

2. **Configure the Main Module**  
   - Set **Looping** if you want continuous effects (snow, rain).  
   - Adjust **Start Lifetime**, **Start Speed**, **Start Size** to control how long particles live, how fast, and how big.  
   - Choose **Start Color** for the initial look.  

3. **Adjust Emission & Shape**  
   - Emission → change emission rate or set up bursts.  
   - Shape → select the shape of emission (cone, sphere, box, etc.) and adjust its parameters.  

4. **Preview & Tweak**  
   Move and rotate the emitter, watch how particles behave in real time. Adjust other modules like Color over Lifetime, Size over Lifetime, etc., to refine the visual.  

5. **Use Scripting (Optional but Powerful)**  
   Use code to start, stop, or modify Particle Systems at runtime.  
   Example stub:

```csharp
   using UnityEngine;

   public class ParticleController : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public ParticleSystem ps;

       void Start()
       {
           // Start emission
           ps.Play();
       }

       public void StopParticles()
       {
           ps.Stop();
       }
   }
```

# 🌟 Unity Lighting

Lighting is one of the most powerful tools in Unity for creating mood, realism, and atmosphere in your games. It not only affects how objects look but also impacts performance and player immersion.

---

## 🔦 What is Lighting in Unity?

In Unity, **lighting** determines how objects in a scene are illuminated and perceived by the camera. Lighting can simulate sunlight, lamps, glowing effects, or even abstract moods.

Unity’s Lighting system consists of three main parts:

1. **Light Components** (Directional, Point, Spot, Area)
2. **Global Illumination (GI)** (real-time or baked light bounces)
3. **Environment Lighting** (skybox, ambient light, reflection probes)

---

## 💡 Types of Light Components

Unity provides several built-in light types, each useful for different scenarios:

| Light Type                  | Use Case                                   | Icon | Notes                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Directional Light**       | Simulates sunlight or moonlight            | ☀️   | Parallel rays; great for outdoor scenes.           |
| **Point Light**             | Emits light in all directions from a point | 💡   | Ideal for lamps, torches, glowing objects.         |
| **Spot Light**              | Cone-shaped light, like a flashlight       | 🔦   | Perfect for focused effects like stage lights.     |
| **Area Light** (Baked only) | Rectangular light source                   | 📐   | Great for soft indoor lighting, windows, or lamps. |

---

## ⚙️ Key Light Component Properties

When you select a Light in Unity, you’ll see these common settings in the **Inspector**:

* **Type** → Directional, Point, Spot, Area
* **Color** → Tint of the light (warm, cool, dramatic tones)
* **Intensity** → Brightness of the light
* **Range** (Point/Spot only) → Distance the light reaches
* **Spot Angle** (Spot only) → Width of the cone
* **Shadows** → Enable and adjust **Hard** or **Soft Shadows**
* **Mode** →

* **Realtime** – Updates every frame, dynamic but costly
* **Baked** – Precomputed, static, performance-friendly
* **Mixed** – Combines real-time and baked

---

## 🌍 Global Illumination (GI)

Lighting doesn’t stop at direct rays — **GI** simulates how light bounces around the scene.

* **Realtime GI** → Updates dynamically (good for day/night cycles).
* **Baked GI** → Precomputed for static environments (faster runtime performance).

Unity’s **Lighting Window** (`Window > Rendering > Lighting`) lets you configure GI, skyboxes, ambient light, and reflection probes.

---

## 🖼️ Environment Lighting

* **Skybox** → Wraps the scene with a 360° texture (day, night, fantasy worlds).
* **Ambient Light** → Adds soft light to areas not hit by direct lights.
* **Reflection Probes** → Capture reflections for shiny surfaces.

---

## 🎮 Hands-On Example

1. Create a **new Unity 3D Scene**.
2. Add a **Directional Light** (if not already present).
3. Change its **Rotation** to simulate different times of day.
4. Add a **Point Light** to a lantern or object.
5. Enable **Shadows** and experiment with **Intensity** and **Range**.
6. Open **Window > Rendering > Lighting** and adjust:

* Skybox material
* Ambient color
* Enable Baked GI

- **Animator Controller**: A state machine that manages multiple animations and transitions.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Animator Component** | Attaches to a GameObject to control animations. |
| **Animation Clip** | A single animation sequence (e.g., walk, run, jump). |
| **Animator Controller** | Organizes animation clips in states and transitions. |
| **Blend Trees** | Smoothly blend between multiple animations based on parameters. |
| **Root Motion** | Moves the GameObject in world space according to the animation. |

---

## ⚙️ Unity Animator Setup

1. **Add Animator Component**
   - Select your character in the **Hierarchy**.
   - Click **Add Component → Animator**.
   - Create or assign an **Animator Controller**.

2. **Open Animator Controller**

    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Alpha1))
        {
            cam1.Priority = 10;
            cam2.Priority = 0;
        }
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Alpha2))
        {
